This public building consists of a Day care centre for older people, office spaces, stores, a multipurpose hall and an  underground parking. The total area of t he building is 1066,00 m². The “brushed aside” -a construction of white parapet- is
used for consolidation of facades with the unification of horizontal surfaces with vertical elements. Thus the wooden
panels offer an ecological parameter to the project while also serving as shading panels.

The bioclimatic character of the building is also achieved through: a) the care for natural lighting and ventilation b) the
controlled shading of glazing, with wooden and aluminum louvers and pergolas, c) the use of environment-friendly
materials, d) the formation of green spaces, green roofs that enable the natural cooling during the summer.
